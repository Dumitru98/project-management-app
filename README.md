# task-manager

TODO: 
	UI:
		- Loading icon
		- To access the given tasks, you have to console.log the response.data.tasks, and then you will see the structure
		- Regex and fail safes for create group page + bootstrap notify
		- Make a mapGetter for the tasks list (calin)
		- Check tasksModified only if the user is in a group

	SERVER:
		- Unhardcode group when get tasks "test"
		- Try/catch ?
		- Implement with redis -> put in npm install

	IDEAS:
		- Messages per task (like a mini watsapp)
		- A given task can be assigned to multiple persons, and one of them has to take it
